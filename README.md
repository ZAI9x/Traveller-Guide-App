# Traveller-Guide-App

The Traveler Guide App comprises two primary sections: currency exchange and ticket prices. Our team successfully built the app during our foundational course in computer science, CS111 Python, to help travelers check the currency exchange and ticket prices for the Gulf region. We utilized the Python tkinter graphical user interface (GUI) library to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
